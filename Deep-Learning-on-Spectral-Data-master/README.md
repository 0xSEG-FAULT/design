## Description
This code repository is for experiments done using ML on Spectral data. Specifically, to determine the concentrations of multiple substances from a mixture/solution using their absorption/reflection spectrum.
The `main.py` file contains a sequence of experiments as separate sections of code. Each section that may be individually enabled to run that specific experiment, such as exploring a data set or training a neural network.
