// Description of dataset: 
Description
These datasets are derived from Raman spectroscopy collected from the reflection of a laser after passing glucose fluid with different fixed glucose levels. These datasets were produced by a large-size Raman spectrometer at Vietnam National University, Hanoi.
There are 2 datasets, including a dense dataset and a spare dataset.
The glucose levels in the dense dataset include 14 levels. Each level has 5 samples. The total number of sample is 70.
The glucose levels in the spare dataset include 10 levels. Each level has 5 samples. The total number of sample is 50.
The files in each of the two datasets include 2 CSV files: the data file and the label file.
[1] The data file contains all Raman scattering sequences. Each sequence lies in a row and has 2048 numbers.
[2] The label file contains all label code Raman scattering sequences in the data file [1]. Each label code lies in a row, which is the label of the Raman scattering sequence in the same row in the data file [1].
Details:
Tenlabels_RamanData.csv: The data file of the spare dataset.
Tenlabels_labels.csv: The label file of the spare dataset.
Fourteenlabels_RamanData.csv: The data file of the dense dataset.
Fourteenlabels_labels.csv: The label file of the dense dataset.
