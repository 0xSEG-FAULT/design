// Description of dataset: 
Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) is a promising technique that could be used for continuous blood glucose monitoring in the treatment of diabetic patients. Four interferents were introduced to study how the glucose predictions varied with interferent concentration. The solutions were mixed with glucose, lactate, ethanol, acetaminophen and caffeine in PBS. A paper has been published on the results in Journal of Biophotonics: https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.202000450.
--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------
// Description of sources and methods used for collection/generation of data: 
The data was collected using a NIR Systems XDS Rapid Content Analyzer Spectrometer (Metrohm Nordic AS, Oslo, Norway) at NOFIMA, Ås, Norway. 

// Methods for processing the data: 
The absorption data presented here is the raw data from the spectrometer, subjected to -log(I/I0) by the spectrometer software. Further analysis is described in the paper.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR [CalibrationData.txt, ValidationData.txt]
-----------------------------------------

// Variable/Column List: 
The first 9 columns give information about the acquisition and sample mixing, and the remaining 4200 columns are absorption measured at the given wavelength. The 9 information columns are: glucose concentration [mM], Lactate concentration [mM], Acetaminophen concentration [mM], Caffeine concentration [mM], Temperature measured at the end of the acquisition [C], Cuvette number, Day number, and Mixture set number.
