The IDRC-2002 denotes the "Shootout" data sets at the International Diffuse Reflectance Conference (IDRC) in 2002. The IDRC-2002 data sets contain NIR spectra and the quantities of active substances in escitalopram tablets obtained with two NIR transmittance spectrometers from a single manufacturer. Contains two sets of calibration, validation, and test feature sets, taken from two different spectrometers. Contains 3 target variables- weight, hardness, assay. Assay likely represents the concentration of the active ingredient, but the description does not explicitly use the word concentration. Wavelengths from 600 to 1898 nm were used with a step size of 2 nm (total 650 wavelengths).
